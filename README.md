## Welcome to my attempt to become a Software Engineer

It is not an easy thing to decide to change careers, and even more difficult when you still need to work to support your family during the process. What follows is my attempt to turn a dream into reality. I hope you enjoy the ride...

A few things before we get started:

- I will attempt to blog as often as possible, it won't be every day.
- I won't always write about software engineering, it may include ideas, emotions, memes, and Dad Jokes.
- Everything on here will be my own personal opinions and just an expression of myself. I hope no one takes offense.

Here we go...

Today was a busy day based on work, team studies, and starting to learn how to stream on Twitch.

Wow, today was crazy! I was introduced to the wonderful world of Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu. I had dabbled with this before but never liked how it operated when it was first released. But now, with WSL2, and the ability to access the file structure from within File Explorer, I really like what I am seeing. I have decided to move all my projects over to Linux and develop out of that environment. I will leave Windows for work projects. I also like the linux based system since it is open source and mimics MacOS. It is going to take some getting used to, but I think it is totally work it.

Today also included a lot of troubleshooting to get the above system to work. This was great for learning to handle bugs. The background for making this change was because of the latest pull request. Lilly CLI!!! Our team's mascot based CLI just for us. We had to test it and I was having some issues using it on windows inside VSCode. Made some changes, got into the WSL and, BOOM!, it worked.

All in all a great day behind the keyboard!

Yesterday was insanely busy at work. I currently work as a software administrator. I get to do some development work by building web applications for a SaaS product my company uses to handle help desk tickets. This is what opened my eyes to the world of software engineering, and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to use these skills I am learning in a real world environment. It is my goal to become a full fledged software engineer for this company. To do so I have to learn a few new technologies, including SQL, C#, and .NET. This is going to be challenging but is what I will be writing about here for the next few months.

Last night, I installed Visual Studio on my Mac and begin my first C# project of making a Number Guesser game. We will see how it goes.

Today I decided to start a blog. A way to track, document, make fun of, my journey in becoming a software engineer. Now this has been done a million times before by other people, but I still think it is a great way to add some accountability to my life. It will help me in my pursuit as I talk out my process and what happened on a particular day. It doesn't require feedback, but just a place to jot down my thoughts and document my struggles. I just hope that it will spark in me the ability to follow through.
