## Welcome to my attempt to become a Software Engineer 

It is not an easy thing to decide to change careers, and even more difficult when you still need to work to support your family during the process. What follows is my attempt to turn a dream into reality. I hope you enjoy the ride...

A few things before we get started:
    - I will attempt to blog as often as possible, it won't be every day.
    - I won't always write about software engineering, it may include ideas, emotions, memes, and Dad Jokes.
    - Everything on here will be my own personal opinions and just an expression of myself. I hope no one takes offense.

Here we go...

### Day 1, 07/29/2020
Today I decided to start a blog. A way to track, document, make fun of, my journey in becoming a software engineer. Now this has been done a million times before by other people, but I still think it is a great way to add some accountability to my life. It will help me in my pursuit as I talk out my process and what happened on a particular day. It doesn't require feedback, but just a place to jot down my thoughts and document my struggles. I just hope that it will spark in me the ability to follow through.
